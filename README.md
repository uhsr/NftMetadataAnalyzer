# NftMetadataAnalyzer

## Description

A curated collection of Solidity smart contracts employing ECDSA signature recovery and Merkle tree verification for gas-efficient NFT whitelisting and claim mechanisms on ERC-721A tokens.

## Features

- Fetches NFT metadata from decentralized storage solutions like IPFS and Arweave using content addressing.
- Parses and validates ERC-721 and ERC-1155 metadata schemas against community standards.
- Analyzes image and audio NFTs using perceptual hashing algorithms to detect near-duplicate content.
- Generates rarity scores based on attribute frequency within the NFT collection using statistical analysis.
- Identifies potential security vulnerabilities in smart contracts associated with NFT metadata using static analysis.
- Visualizes NFT metadata attribute distributions using interactive charts and graphs based on D3.js.
- Stores analyzed NFT metadata in a normalized database schema optimized for querying and filtering.
- Exposes a GraphQL API for programmatic access to analyzed NFT metadata and rarity scores.
## Installation
