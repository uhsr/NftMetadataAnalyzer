- Analyzes image hashes (e.g., perceptual hashes) to detect near-duplicate NFTs across different marketplaces.
- Generates interactive visualizations of NFT attribute distributions using D3.js.
- Implements a GraphQL API for querying NFT metadata, rarity scores, and duplicate detection results.
- Stores processed NFT metadata in a PostgreSQL database with optimized indexing for fast retrieval.
